# Disc Playlist Creator

A simple m3u playlist creator in Python aimed at muOS and Retro Acheivements users.

Creates m3u playlists and add a prefix to the original files so that they're hidden in the muOS explorer.

**NB: Currently supports CHD files only.**

*Support for other common files and automatic conversion to chd is planned for the future.*

## Usage

Download the Disc_Playlist_Creator file in dist and run it in the folder with the disc files.

To specify a folder open a terminal in the folder where you have placed the executable and run the following:

`./Disc_Playlist_Generator /path/to/discs`

If you're on windows you can install python and run the .py file as a python script.
